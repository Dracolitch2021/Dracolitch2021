Constant learning is my thing. I have a very extensive general knowledge at it relates to cyber security and Risk management. 
I wish I was specialized like so many of the other people I see on here, however I plan to use my skills to properly place people in a position that best fits them,
  understand what allows them to excel on a project, protect them and their reputation/ego, and allow them to grow and explore the areas that interest them. I feel
   strongly that what IT and cyber is missing most is great leadership. I want to develop a team that allows each member to feed off the skills of the others and 
   allow the combined effort to bring all members to success. This means I want each member to pull their weight, release their ego, trust in each other, and acheeve 
   greatness! I love to be apreciated for my efforts like all people, but unlike most, it only means something comming from those that are important to me, I cant stand
   to be in the spotlight, unless it happens to be with my inner circle. Lets work together and build the biggest cyber security consuting team the world has ever seen.
